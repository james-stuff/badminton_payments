This is the program I use to manage a weekly badminton session I host.  There are usually 20-30 attendees.  The costs (mainly court hire) are split equally and most people pay me by bank transfer shortly after each session.  The original purpose of this app was to automate the reconciliation of payments against attendees, but it has since evolved to encompass many other aspects of the process.  Runs locally using Command Line Interface.

A list of signed-up attendees is copied from a WhatsApp group chat into a Google Sheet (to allow calculations and recording of cash payments on the night).  Following a session, a .csv file is manually downloaded from my internet banking account.  Transactions are analysed using pandas and a mapping table stored in a MongoDB database to reconcile against the attendee list (retrieved, along with other details, via Google Sheets API), making it very easy to keep track of the payments.  Handles complexities such as: people not always referring to themselves with the same name, payments on behalf of partners/friends, etc., late payments for previous sessions.  Also keeps track of monthly invoices from the venue.
